# 🎵 Hearmony: Your Emotional Echo

The *Hearmony* is a deep learning-based project that identifies human emotions from speech using spectrograms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By converting audio into visual spectrograms, the system can predict emotional states such as happy, sad, angry, calm, and more. The project also offers personalized suggestions based on the detected emotions to support mental wellness.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### ✅ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Required Libraries:

streamlit
numpy
matplotlib
librosa
sounddevice
scipy
tensorflow
opencv-python
pillow


### 🎬 Steps to Run

1. *Train the Model (Optional)*
   - Use train_cnn.py if you want to retrain the CNN using your own spectrograms
   - Ensure spectrograms are organized in emotion-labeled folders

2. *Launch the Web Application*
   bash
   streamlit run app.py
   

3. *Record Voice & Analyze*
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the Streamlit interface
   - Click "Capture Your Voice" to record your voice for 5 seconds
   - The system converts audio to mel spectrogram, predicts emotion, and shows results
   - View personalized suggestions based on your detected emotion
